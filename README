This is intended for LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY, NOT TO SPAM FORUMS!

This class provides easy login/post/reputation/signature functions for vBulletin forums,
You may use it however you wish, but I take no responsibility for your actions, or actions of others.

Modules included:
- vbshout_module.php - For forums using InfernoShout
- usercp_module.php - For all forums, used to update signatures/set usergroups
- thanks_module.php - For forums with the 'thanks' mod installed

To disable any modules, simply create a folder called "disabled" and move them into there.

TODO:
- Confirmation of posting threads/sending visitor messages/thanking etc

--------------------------

Update by dgranda, focus on reply to post (weekly_races.php using formPanel.php controller)

1.- Retrieve credentials stored in forum_data.php
2.- Read data from spreadsheet hosted in Google Docs (published as csv feed)
3.- Parse feed to obtain races which are planned for current week
4.- Build proper bb code to post to target thread in forum
5.- Pass checks:
	· Security question (hardcoded)
	· One post per day limit
6.- Post message in forum (signature will be displayed by default)

Technical details:

- Added some logic to prevent not authorized use:
	· Basic authentication
	· Security question before posting (hardcoded)
	· Only allows one post per day -> lock file (check write permissions!)
- Second post after login to retrieve security token
- Default curl method is post x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart otherwise
- Simple feedback to user
