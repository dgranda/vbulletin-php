This is intended for LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY, NOT TO SPAM FORUMS!

This class provides easy login/post/reputation/signature functions for vBulletin forums,
You may use it however you wish, but I take no responsibility for your actions, or actions of others.

Modules included:
- vbshout_module.php - For forums using InfernoShout
- usercp_module.php - For all forums, used to update signatures/set usergroups
- thanks_module.php - For forums with the 'thanks' mod installed

To disable any modules, simply create a folder called "disabled" and move them into there.

TODO:
- Confirmation of posting threads/sending visitor messages/thanking etc

--------------------------

Update by dgranda, focus on reply to post. Two approaches:

a) One step -> weekly.php
b) Two steps -> weekly_races.php using formPanel.php controller

0.- Basic authentication
1.- Retrieve credentials stored in forum_data.php
2.- Read data from spreadsheet hosted in Google Docs (published as csv feed)
3.- Parse feed to obtain races which are planned for current week
4.- Build proper bb code to post to target thread in forum
5.- Pass checks:
	· Security question (hardcoded, just for the 2 steps approach)
	· One post per day limit
6.- Post message in forum (signature will be displayed by default)

Technical details:

- Added some logic to prevent not authorized use:
	· Basic authentication
	· Security question before posting (hardcoded, just for the 2 steps approach)
	· Only allows one post per day -> lock file (check write permissions!)
- Second post after login to retrieve security token
- Default curl method is post x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart otherwise
- Simple feedback to user

# Automation (just for 1 step approach) usually via crontab:

1.- Get basic authentication credentials (see .htpasswd file!) encoded in base64:

$ echo -n <user:password> | base64
<basic_auth_credentials_base64_encoded>

2.- Prepare request:

curl -vv http://<your_domain>/<path>/weekly.php -H "Authorization: Basic <basic_auth_credentials_base64_encoded>"
